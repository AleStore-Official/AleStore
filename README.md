# 🌐 AleStore Official – Personal Website

Hi there! 👋 This is the repository for my personal website, published via GitHub Pages.  
It’s not a commercial project, nor a platform designed to handle critical operations like banking, healthcare, or enterprise workloads.  
It’s my personal online space where I experiment, build, and refine modern web experiences with real authentication, databases, and security layers.

## 🧭 What is this project?

A modern web project that started as a simple static website and evolved into a more advanced, feature‑rich personal platform.  
I use it to:

- test and showcase ideas  
- experiment with UI/UX  
- integrate real‑world features like authentication and databases  
- maintain an online presence and playground for my work  

It’s not meant to be a polished commercial product, but a living project that I update and refactor whenever I want to try something new.

## 🛠️ Technologies used

Core technologies:

- **HTML** – structure  
- **CSS** – styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – dynamic functionality and client logic  

Advanced features (depending on the section/environment):

- **Authentication systems** (e.g. email/password, tokens, etc.)  
- **Databases** (for persistent data and structured storage)  
- **Security checks and validation**  
- **Google reCAPTCHA** (to reduce spam/abuse in forms or interactions)  

The exact stack may evolve over time as I improve and extend the project.

## 🔐 Security & Responsibility

While this project uses **authentication systems**, **databases**, and **reCAPTCHA** to improve security and reliability, it is still:

- a personal project  
- experimental in nature  
- not designed or certified for highly sensitive or mission‑critical use  

It may handle user data in certain areas (e.g. accounts, forms, or stored content), but:

- it is not meant for financial data, medical data, or highly confidential information  
- it is not guaranteed to meet enterprise‑grade compliance or certifications  

> ⚠️ Use at your own risk.  
> This project is provided “as is”, without any warranty, support, or formal guarantees of security, uptime, or correctness.

If you reuse parts of this code or architecture, you are responsible for reviewing, adapting, and securing them for your own use cases.
