# 🌐 AleStore Official – Personal Website

Hi there! 👋 This is the repository for my personal website, published via GitHub Pages.  
It’s not a commercial project, nor a platform designed to handle sensitive data or critical operations.  
It’s simply my online space where I experiment, share content, and keep track of what I enjoy building.

## 🧭 What is this project?

A static website — simple and straightforward.  
I use it to share ideas, test code, publish documentation, or just maintain an online presence.  
It’s not meant to be a finished product, but rather a flexible container I update whenever I feel like it.

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- **HTML** – structure  
- **CSS** – styling  
- **JavaScript** – dynamic functionality  

No frameworks, no backend, no databases — just clean and lightweight code.
